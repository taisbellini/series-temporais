# Introduction


- 


## Motivation

- Use modern machine learning techniques to build on well established macroeconomics factors literature with respect to asset price prediction.

- The main goal is to use macroeconomics factors to build an optimal asset portfolio of indexes that protects against extreme losses (left tail returns) while still offering adequate returns.

## Proposal

- Framework for portfolio optimization of six index funds

# Fundamentals

## GARCH

- In order to model each univariate macroeconomic factor volatility, a GARCH(1,1) model is proposed. 

- Volatility is modeled using a GARCH(1,1) because the majority of financial assets share common 'stylized facts':
\item Heavy Tails: the distribution of returns usually shows heavier tails than Normal or t distribution: extreme losses or gains aren't that rare. 
\item Gain/Loss Asymmetry: large downturn in assets prices do not necessarily reflect equally large upturns. 
\item Volatility Clustering: high volatility events tends to cluster over time. Economic crisis. 
- Thus, using simple asset's standard deviation as a risk measure can be problematic.

## Pair Copula and Dependence Modeling

- GARCH(1,1) model is able to capture univariate volatility. However, it is well known that dependence between financial assets exist.
- During crisis, financial assets exhibits different dependence structures with respect to normal or bullish market conditions: they tend to have a very correlated loss dynamic. 
- Copula-GARCH models are able to capture the multivariate assets dependence while multivariate probability function estimation is not needed. 

## More about copula

- The main advantage of using copulas is that it allows separating the marginal assets distribution (here modeled using GARCH) from the dependence structure. Then, different dependence behaviors can be captured by different copula functions. 

\begin{theorem}
Let $F$ be an n-dimensional distribution function with margins $F_1,...F_n$. Then there exists an n-copula $C$ such that for all $y \in R^n$, \begin{equation}
F(y_1,...,y_n) = C(F_1(y_1),...,F_n(y_n)).
\end{equation} Furthermore, if $F_1,...F_n$ are continuous, then $C$ is unique.
\end{theorem}

## More about copula
\begin{corollary}
Let $f$ be the multivariate probability density function the probability distribution $F$ and $f_1,...,f_n$ the univariate probability density functions of the margins $F_1,...,F_n$. The copulas density function of an n-copula $C$ is the function c: $U[0,1]^n \mapsto [0,\infty)$ such that \begin{equation}
      c(u_1,...,u_n)= \frac{\partial^n C(u_1,...,u_n)}{\partial u_1,...,\partial u_n} =                \frac{f(y_1,...,y_n)}{\prod^{n}_{i=1}f_i(y_i)}.
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}

## How this all connects

Using theorems above, the conditional joint distribution can be decomposed, given previous information set, into conditional marginal distributions and conditional copulas. For $t \in (1,...,T)$ let $Y_t|I_{t-1} \sim F(.|I_{t-1})$ and $Y_{i,t}|I_{t-1} \sim F_i(.|I_{t-1})$, then \begin{equation}
F(y|I_{t-1}) = C(F_1(y_1|I_{t-1}),..., F_n(y_n|I_{t-1})|I_{t-1})
\end{equation}

Then, from the GARCH(1,1) model, we incorporate equation (VER) to the multivariate copula and the white-noise term ${z_t}$ can be derived from the copula structure: \begin{equation}
z_t|I_{t-1} \sim F_{z,t} = C_t(F_{1,t}, ... , F_{n,t}) \end{equation} where $z_t$ can then be estimated from \begin{equation}
\frac{R_t - \mu}{\sigma_t|I_{t-1}} \end{equation}

## Pair Copula (PCC)

- Different copula functions captures different kinds of dependence. 
- t-copula is symmetrical and captures both upper and lower tail dependence. Clayton copula captures lower tail, etc. 
- Computation requirements to estimate multivariate copula parameters increases with dimension of time-series. 
- However, multivariate joint density can be written as a product of pair copula on different conditional distributions.
- Copula parameters are then estimated with log-likelihood optimization along de layers of pair copula trees. 
- Final model is the one that optimizes AIC. 

## Neural Networks

## Mean CVaR

- Traditional portfolio optimization follows Markowitz mean-variance model. 
- As mentioned earlier, there's a need to model lower tail risk. New risk measures introduced. 
- VaR (Value at Risk): VaR is defined as $VaR_{\beta}(w) = min(l \in R: \psi(w,l) \ge \beta)$. It can be interpreted as the loss at the $\beta$ percentile. However, VaR has some limitations (not coherent, difficult to apply in a portfolio optimization problem). 
- CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk): CVaR is defined as \begin{equation} CVaR_\beta(w) = \frac{1}{1-\beta}\int_{f(w,y)\ge VaR_{\beta(w)}}f(w,y)p(y)dy, \end{equation} where $y$ represents returns with density $p(y)$ and $f(w,y)$ is a loss function. It can be interpreted as the mean loss from VaR to $-\infty$. 
- CVaR is a coherent risk measure and the optimization w.r.t to a portfolio is well defined and easier to be done. 

## mean-CVaR portfolio optimization

- An easier discretized version function can be used to calculate $CVaR_\beta$ approximating the integral above: \begin{equation}
F_\beta(w,l) = l + \frac{1}{q(1+\beta)}\sum^{q}_{k = 1}[f(w, y_k)-l]^{+}.\end{equation} Minimizing CVaR is thus the equivalent of minimizing $F_\beta(w,l)$. The final mean-CVaR portfolio optimization is then defined as: 
\begin{equation}
min_{w \in W} F_\beta(w,l) = l + \frac{1}{q(1+\beta)}\sum^{q}_{k = 1}S_k 
s.t. S_k \ge f(w, y_k) - l = -w^Ty_k - l 
S_k \ge 0
\sum^{N}_{i=1}w_i = 1
w^Ty \ge \mu_0
\end{equation} where $S_k$ is an auxiliary term to approximate $[f(w,y_k)-l]^+$ so that the optimization can be solved as a Linear Programming problem (Simplex or Interior Point).

- Process: find optimal weights $w_{k,output}$ and $w_{jk}$ that minimize the following error function:

$$\hat{y_i} = \phi_{output}\left(\alpha_1 + \sum_{k \rightarrow output}{w_{k,output}\phi\left(\alpha_k+\sum_{j \rightarrow k}w_{jk}x_{ij}\right)}\right)$$
