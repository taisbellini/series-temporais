## Neural Network {.allowframebreaks}

- Explore the relationships between macroeconomic factors and financial assets returns
- A feedforward neural network with one hidden layer and one output layer that takes the simulation of 11 major macroeconomic factors as input and produces the return of 6 vehicle investment assets
- Process: find optimal weights $w_{k,output}$ and $w_{jk}$ that minimize the following error function:

$$\hat{y_i} = \phi_{output}\left(\alpha_1 + \sum_{k \rightarrow output}{w_{k,output}\phi\left(\alpha_k+\sum_{j \rightarrow k}w_{jk}x_{ij}\right)}\right)$$
$\alpha$ is a bias term and $\phi$ default to $\left(\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}\right)$

- Gradient descent to iteractively update $w_{jk}$
